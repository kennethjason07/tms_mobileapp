# WhatsApp Notification Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the Meta AI WhatsApp API to send automatic notifications when orders are completed.

## üöÄ Features Added

- **Automatic WhatsApp Notifications**: When all orders for a bill are marked as "completed", the system automatically sends a WhatsApp message to the customer
- **Customer Information Retrieval**: Fetches customer name and mobile number from the bills table
- **Order Details**: Includes order details in the notification message
- **Configuration Screen**: Easy-to-use setup screen for API credentials

## üì± Meta AI WhatsApp API Setup

### Step 1: Create Meta Developer Account

1. Go to [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com)
2. Sign in with your Facebook account
3. Create a new app or use an existing one
4. Add the "WhatsApp" product to your app

### Step 2: Get Your Phone Number ID

1. In your Meta app dashboard, go to **WhatsApp > Getting Started**
2. Note down your **Phone Number ID** (this is a long number)
3. This will be used in the API URL

### Step 3: Generate Access Token

1. Go to **System Users** in your app dashboard
2. Create a new system user with admin role
3. Generate a token with the following permissions:
   - `whatsapp_business_messaging`
   - `whatsapp_business_management`
4. Copy the generated token (keep it secure!)

### Step 4: Configure Webhook (Optional)

For two-way messaging capabilities:

1. Set up a webhook URL for message delivery
2. Verify the webhook with Meta
3. This enables receiving messages from customers

### Step 5: Configure in the App

1. Open the TMS app
2. Go to **Orders Overview** screen
3. Tap the WhatsApp icon (üí¨) in the header
4. Enter your credentials:
   - **Phone Number ID**: Your Meta Phone Number ID
   - **Access Token**: Your generated access token
5. Click "Test Connection" to verify setup
6. Click "Save Credentials" to store them

## üîß How It Works

### Automatic Notification Trigger

When you mark an order as "completed" in the Orders Overview:

1. The system checks if ALL orders for that bill are completed
2. If yes, it fetches customer information from the bills table
3. Generates a personalized WhatsApp message
4. Sends the notification to the customer's mobile number

### Message Format

```
üéâ Order Completed!

Dear [Customer Name],

Your order (Bill #[Bill Number]) has been completed and is ready for delivery!

Order Details:
‚Ä¢ [Garment Type]: [Quantity] piece(s)
