# NewBillScreen Input Functionality Fix

## Issue Identified:
The input fields in NewBillScreen were not working due to **scope issues** in the PDF generation functions.

## Root Cause:
Several helper functions in the `generateBillHTMLFromTemplate` function were trying to access React state variables (`itemizedBill`, `billData`) that exist only within the component scope, but the functions were defined outside the component.

## Functions That Caused the Issue:
1. `generateBillItemsTable()` - Accessed `itemizedBill` state
2. `getTotalQuantity()` - Accessed `itemizedBill` state  
3. `getTotalAmount()` - Accessed `itemizedBill` state

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. **Parameterized Functions**
```javascript
// BEFORE (causing errors):
function generateBillItemsTable() {
  const items = [
    { name: 'Suit', qty: itemizedBill.suit_qty || '0', ... }
    // ❌ itemizedBill was undefined outside component scope
  ];
}

// AFTER (fixed):
function generateBillItemsTable(itemizedBillData) {
  const items = [
    { name: 'Suit', qty: itemizedBillData.suit_qty || '0', ... }
    // ✅ itemizedBillData is properly passed as parameter
  ];
}
```

### 2. **Updated Function Calls**
```javascript
// BEFORE:
const billItemsTable = generateBillItemsTable();
const totalQuantity = getTotalQuantity();
const totalAmount = getTotalAmount();

// AFTER:
const billItemsTable = generateBillItemsTable(itemizedBill);
const totalQuantity = getTotalQuantity(itemizedBill);
const totalAmount = getTotalAmount(itemizedBill);
```

### 3. **Fixed Functions:**
- `generateBillItemsTable(itemizedBillData)` - Now accepts itemized bill data as parameter
- `getTotalQuantity(itemizedBillData)` - Now accepts itemized bill data as parameter
- `getTotalAmount(itemizedBillData)` - Now accepts itemized bill data as parameter

## Result:
- ✅ Input fields in NewBillScreen now work properly
- ✅ PDF generation still functions correctly
- ✅ Measurements section remains integrated as requested
- ✅ All React state variables are properly scoped within the component

## Technical Details:
The issue occurred because JavaScript was trying to reference undefined variables (`itemizedBill`, `billData`) in the global scope, which likely caused the entire component to fail to render or function properly, blocking all input interactions.

By properly parameterizing these functions, we ensure they receive the data they need without trying to access React state from outside the component scope.
