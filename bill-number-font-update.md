## Change Applied:
Increased the **bill number font size** in the measurements section from **9px to 14px** to match the measurements text for consistency.

## Font Size Update:

| Element | Before | After | Change |
|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Bill Number** ("Bill No: 1001") | 9px | **14px** | **+55% larger** |
| Measurements Text | 14px | **14px** | No change |
| Title ("Customer Measurements") | 13px | **13px** | No change |

## CSS Change Applied:

```css
.measurements-header {
  font-size: 14px;          /* Increased from 9px */
  color: #666;
  margin-bottom: 3px;
  text-align: center;
  font-weight: 500;
}
```

## Visual Impact:

### **BEFORE:**
```
Customer Measurements          ← 13px (prominent)
Bill No: 1001                 ← 9px (small/subtle)

Pant: Length: 42, Kamar: 34   ← 14px (large)
```

### **AFTER:**
```
Customer Measurements          ← 13px (now smallest!)
Bill No: 1001                 ← 14px (LARGE & PROMINENT)

Pant: Length: 42, Kamar: 34   ← 14px (matches bill number)
```

## Benefits:

## New Font Hierarchy:
