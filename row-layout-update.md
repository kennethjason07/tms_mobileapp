# Measurements Layout Changed to Row Format

## Change Made:
Converted the measurements display from **two-column layout** to **row-based layout** for better readability and scanning.

## Before (Column Layout):
```
Customer Measurements
Bill No: 1001

Pant Length: 42        Pant Kamar: 34
Pant Hips: 36         Shirt Length: 30
Shirt Shoulder: 18    Shirt Collar: 15
```

## After (Row Layout):
```
Customer Measurements
Bill No: 1001

Pant Length: 42
Pant Kamar: 34
Pant Hips: 36
Shirt Length: 30
Shirt Shoulder: 18
Shirt Collar: 15
```

## CSS Changes Applied:

### 1. **Layout Structure:**
```css
/* BEFORE - Column layout */
.measurements-content {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 6px;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
.measurement-item {
  flex: 0 1 48%;  /* Two columns */
}

/* AFTER - Row layout */
.measurements-content {
  display: block;
  line-height: 1.3;
}
.measurement-item {
  display: block;  /* Each item on its own line */
  margin-bottom: 2px;
}
```

### 2. **Improved Spacing:**
- Added margin-right: 4px to measurement labels
- Added margin-right: 12px to measurement values  
- Increased line-height to 1.3 for better readability
- Set margin-bottom: 2px between measurement rows

## Benefits of Row Layout:

✅ **Easier to Scan**: Measurements flow naturally from top to bottom
✅ **Better Readability**: Each measurement is clearly separated
✅ **More Professional**: Clean vertical list appearance  
✅ **Consistent Spacing**: Uniform gaps between all measurements
✅ **Still Compact**: Maintains single-page fit while improving clarity

## Font Sizes Maintained:
- Title: 13px (prominent)
- Bill number: 9px (clear)  
- Measurements: 9px (readable)

The row-based layout provides a cleaner, more professional appearance while maintaining the compact design that fits on a single page!
