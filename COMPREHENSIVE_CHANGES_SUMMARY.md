## üîß MAJOR SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS

### 1. üí∞ **TWO-STAGE REVENUE RECOGNITION SYSTEM** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
**Files Modified:** `supabase.js`, `NewBillScreen.js`, `DailyProfitScreen.js`, `setup_revenue_tracking.sql`

#### **What This Fixes:**
- Previously, revenue was only recorded when orders were completed
- Now records revenue in two stages for better cash flow tracking

#### **New Features:**
- **Stage 1 (Advance):** Revenue recorded immediately when customer pays advance during bill creation
- **Stage 2 (Final):** Remaining balance recorded when admin marks order as "paid"
- New `revenue_tracking` table to store all payment history
- Enhanced daily profit calculations include both stages

#### **New API Methods Added:**
```javascript
// Record advance payment during bill creation
SupabaseAPI.recordAdvancePayment(orderId, billId, customerName, advanceAmount, totalBillAmount)

// Enhanced bill creation with automatic advance tracking
SupabaseAPI.createBillWithAdvanceTracking(billData, orderData)

// Calculate profit with two-stage revenue recognition
SupabaseAPI.calculateProfit(date)

// Enhanced payment status update with final payment tracking
SupabaseAPI.updatePaymentStatus(orderId, newStatus)
```

#### **Database Changes:**
- **New Table:** `revenue_tracking` with columns:
  - `order_id`, `bill_id`, `customer_name`
  - `payment_type` ('advance' or 'final')
  - `amount`, `total_bill_amount`, `remaining_balance`
  - `payment_date`, `recorded_at`, `status`

---

### 2. üë• **CUSTOMER INFO SCREEN FIXES** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
**Files Modified:** `supabase.js`, `CustomerInfoScreen.js`

#### **What This Fixes:**
- Customer orders were not displaying detailed information
- Missing bill data prevented order expansion by garment type
- Data transformation issues between API and UI

#### **Improvements Made:**
- **Enhanced API:** `getCustomerInfo()` now properly joins bill data with orders
- **Robust Expansion:** Order expansion by garment type works even with missing bill data
- **Better Error Handling:** Graceful fallback when data is incomplete
- **Comprehensive Debugging:** Added detailed console logging throughout the process

#### **New Data Structure:**
```javascript
// Enhanced customer data format
{
  customer_orders: [...],     // New format with bill data embedded
  order_history: [...],       // Backwards compatibility
  measurements: {...},
  customer_name: "...",
  mobile_number: "...",
  metadata: {
    total_orders: 5,
    total_bills: 3,
    total_amount: 15000,
    last_updated: "..."
  }
}
```

### 4. üìè **FRACTIONAL INPUT SYSTEM** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
**Files Modified:** `NewBillScreen.js`, `components/FractionalInput.js`

#### **What This Fixes:**
- Difficult measurement input for fractional values
- Inconsistent measurement storage and display
- Poor user experience for tailoring measurements

#### **New Component Features:**
```javascript
<FractionalInput
  value={measurement}
  onChangeText={setMeasurement}
  allowText={false}  // For numeric measurements
  placeholder="Enter measurement"
  style={styles.input}
/>
```

#### **Capabilities:**
- **Smart Input:** Handles fractions (1 1/2), decimals (1.5), and whole numbers (1)
- **Text Mode:** Supports text entries for special measurements
- **Validation:** Real-time validation with visual feedback
